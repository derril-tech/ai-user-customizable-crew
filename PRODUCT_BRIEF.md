🤖 User-Customizable AI Crew — Team-in-a-Box SaaS 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 
 “Spin up a ready-made AI team in one click — CEO, CTO, marketer, teacher, podcaster, trader, or doctor — fully customizable, collaborative, and enterprise-safe.” 

What it produces 

AI crews (collections of specialized agents) tailored to startup, education, podcast, marketing, legal, devops, healthcare, and more. 

Shared dashboards to manage crew tasks, outputs, and workflows. 

Multi-modal outputs: text docs, reports, marketing assets, quizzes, voiceovers, legal contracts, and trading signals. 

Exportable crew templates: JSON definitions of roles, personalities, prompts, and workflows. 

Real-time monitoring: logs, cost breakdowns, safety compliance, and drift detection. 

Scope/Safety 

All crews operate in sandboxed workspaces with RBAC. 

API keys & credentials pulled from encrypted vaults. 

Compliance guardrails (PII scrubbing, output moderation, red-flag policies). 

Crew cost budgets, timeouts, and backoff/retries. 

 

2) Target User 

Startups & Founders (CEO/CTO/Marketer crews for bootstrap ops). 

Educators & Students (teacher + quizmaster + tutor crews). 

Podcasters & Media Teams (scriptwriter + editor + host + researcher crews). 

Marketers & Agencies (copywriter, designer, social scheduler crews). 

Traders & Analysts (market analyst, risk manager, execution bot crews). 

Legal Teams (contract drafter, compliance checker crews). 

Healthcare Providers (symptom checker, scheduler, coach). 

Enterprise IT / DevOps (CI/CD monitor, bug reporter, auto-tester). 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive) 

Crew Creation & Management 

Inputs: crewType (startup, education, etc.), roles[], goals[], budgetLimits, compliancePolicies[], integrations (Slack, Notion, Jira). 

Crew Builder agent produces: crew.json (definition), roles.json, workflows.json, governance.json. 

Marketplace of prebuilt crews (Startup Pack, Podcast Pack, Trading Pack). 

User customization: swap agents, adjust personalities, change workflows, import/export crew definitions. 

Crew Execution 

Crew Orchestrator agent manages turn-taking, message routing, and state. 

Each role: dedicated prompt template, tools, and memory. 

Multi-modal support: text, audio (TTS), video (via external connectors), structured outputs (JSON/CSV). 

Sandbox execution with retries, drift detection, and budget checks. 

Governance & Compliance 

Safety Policy Enforcer agent: blocks unsafe or non-compliant outputs. 

Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for high-risk decisions. 

Logging of all interactions, retrievable via Audit Dashboard. 

Cost tracker per agent/crew with alerts. 

Integrations & Exports 

Integrations: Slack, Discord, Jira, Notion, Trello, Google Docs, Figma, Trading APIs, healthcare scheduling APIs. 

Exports: crew.json, workflow diagrams, logs, cost breakdowns, compliance reports. 

SDKs for embedding a crew into external apps. 

 

4) Backend Architecture (Extremely Detailed & Deployment-Ready) 

4.0 Orchestration (agents + pipeline) 

Agents (workers) 

crew-builder → generates crew.json, roles.json, workflows.json. 

orchestrator → manages inter-agent calls, resolves dependencies. 

executor → runs agent actions, validates outputs. 

safety-enforcer → applies compliance filters & redactions. 

cost-tracker → logs token usage & sends alerts. 

deliverer → aggregates outputs, formats exports, uploads artifacts. 

Control flow: job DAG per crew with retries & idempotency. 

State machine: pending → initializing → running(agent=X) → done | error(agent=X,reason). 

4.1 Topology 

Frontend Host: Next.js 14 (dashboard + marketplace). 

API Gateway: FastAPI 3.11 (/v1/* with Problem+JSON). 

Workers: Python (LangChain / CrewAI orchestration), Node (webhooks). 

Event Bus: NATS (crew.created, agent.done, crew.error). DLQ in Redis Streams. 

Storage: Postgres (multi-tenant metadata), S3/R2 (artifacts), Redis (state/cache). 

Observability: OpenTelemetry → Tempo/Loki/Prometheus; Sentry exceptions. 

4.2 Data Model (Postgres) 

CREATE TABLE orgs (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, plan TEXT DEFAULT 'free'); 
CREATE TABLE users (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, org_id UUID REFERENCES orgs(id), email CITEXT UNIQUE, role TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()); 
 
CREATE TABLE crews (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, org_id UUID REFERENCES orgs(id), name TEXT, type TEXT, status TEXT, budget_limit NUMERIC, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()); 
 
CREATE TABLE agents (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, crew_id UUID REFERENCES crews(id), role TEXT, personality JSONB, tools JSONB, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()); 
 
CREATE TABLE jobs (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, crew_id UUID REFERENCES crews(id), status TEXT, input JSONB, output JSONB, cost NUMERIC, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()); 
 
CREATE TABLE audit_log (id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, org_id UUID, crew_id UUID, action TEXT, meta JSONB, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()); 
 

4.3 API Surface (REST /v1, OpenAPI 3.1) 

POST /v1/crews → create crew. 

GET /v1/crews/:id → fetch crew definition. 

POST /v1/crews/:id/run → execute workflow. 

GET /v1/crews/:id/jobs → list jobs, status. 

GET /v1/jobs/:id/stream → SSE stream of crew execution. 

POST /v1/jobs/:id/retry / cancel. 

POST /v1/crews/:id/export → download crew.json + logs. 

4.4 Pipelines & Workers (Exact Steps) 

crew-builder → orchestrator → parallel role agents → safety-enforcer → deliverer. 

Cost-tracker runs alongside, emits alerts. 

Errors route to DLQ with retry policy. 

4.5 Realtime 

SSE: /v1/jobs/:id/stream → stage, percent, messages. 

WS: ws:crew:{id} for dashboards. 

4.6 Caching & Performance 

Warm agent pools to reduce cold start. 

Cache common prompts & tool outputs. 

Shard crews by org to isolate workloads. 

4.7 Observability 

OTel spans: crew.create, agent.run, enforce.safety, deliver.output. 

KPIs: time-to-output p95, cost per job, drift detection incidents. 

4.8 Security & Compliance 

TLS/HSTS/CSP, workspace-scoped RLS, signed artifact URLs. 

PII redaction + policy enforcement. 

Configurable retention policies. 

 

5) Frontend Architecture (React 18 + Next.js 14) 

5.1 Tech Choices 

UI: Mantine + Tailwind utilities. 

State: TanStack Query + Zustand.

6) SDKs & Integration Contracts 

TypeScript SDK: 

export class CrewSDK { 
  async createCrew(body: CreateCrewBody) {...} 
  async runCrew(crewId: string, input: any) {...} 
  async getJobs(crewId: string) {...} 
  streamProgress(jobId: string, cb: (e:MessageEvent)=>void) {...} 
}

7) DevOps & Deployment 

FE: Vercel. 

API/Workers: Render/Fly.io, autoscaling pools (CPU + GPU). 

DB: Managed Postgres, Redis. 

Storage/CDN: S3/R2 + CloudFront. 

IaC: Terraform for DB, buckets, NATS, Redis. 

SLOs: p95 crew run < 3 min; uptime ≥ 99.5%. 

 

8) Testing 

Unit: role schema validation, policy enforcement. 

Integration: crew.create → run → logs. 

E2E: create crew, run test job, fetch outputs. 

Load: 100 concurrent crews. 

Chaos: worker crash, API rate-limit. 

Security: PII redaction, output moderation tests. 

 

9) Success Criteria 

≥ 80% users find crews usable out-of-the-box. 

Median crew setup < 2 min. 

≥ 70% reuse rate of crew templates. 

p95 job latency < 3 min. 

 

10) Visual/Logical Flows 

Crew Creation Flow 
 Wizard → POST /v1/crews → crew-builder → orchestrator → persisted crew.json. 

Crew Run Flow 
 Run → orchestrator → role agents (parallel/serial) → safety-enforcer → deliverer → artifacts. 

Monitoring Flow 
 Dashboard → SSE stream → Logs + Cost Breakdown → Audit Replay.
